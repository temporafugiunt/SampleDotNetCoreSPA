# Creating and Running a New Project
```
#get lastest SPA templates
dotnet new --install Microsoft.DotNet.Web.Spa.ProjectTemplates::*

#create a new project, default for target framework doesn't seem to be working when .NET Core 2.1 SDK is Installed
dotnet new angular -f netcoreapp2.0 -o test-web-app

#restore nuget packages and NPM packages
cd test-web-app

# run this rather than dotnet restore / npm install
dotnet build

#set proper environment 
set ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development

# run the server
dotnet run
```

You can now browse to http://localhost:5000 and see the default angular seed project.
